Random scripts I wrote that don't really belong anywhere else

**burnc** - cli cd burning script that uses `wodim` and `lame`

**cobpile** - cobol compilation and running script (for class) uses `cobc`

**songofstorms** - uses `beep` program to play song of storms from zelda

**upscrot** - uses `scrot` and `imgur`.  takes screen shot, randomly names, uploads it to imgur, and deletes the original file

**craftbukkit folder** - random scripts for running/downloading craftbukkit server
